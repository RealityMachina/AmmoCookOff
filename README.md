# AmmoCookOff
It's kinda weird you can get your mech to be overly glowing and yet nothing bad can happen. This ModTek mod changes that.

## Installation

Install [BTML](https://github.com/Mpstark/BattleTechModLoader) and [ModTek](https://github.com/Mpstark/ModTek). Extract files to `BATTLETECH\Mods\AmmoCookOff\`.

## General Details
Ammo explosions roll a chance to explode every time your mech overheats, and they roll a more severe chance if you overheat enough to force a shut down.

By default, these values are 10% per box, and 20% per box respectively.

## Configuration

`mod.json` has some settings on how the chances work, and they should be self-explanatory.
